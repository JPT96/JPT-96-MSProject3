# JPT-96-MSProject3(Sink the Sub)

## About
For my Python project I decided to go with a very simple version of battleships. Which I call sink the sub.


## Features
This game cycles through 4 Turns to find this one submarine. 
## design
The design is very basic it sits within five lists essentially filled with O's that turn into an X when shot at.
there has been code put in to determine wether it was a hit, miss, off the board, or already been shot at the same locaation.

### Future Features
I would like the player to put down Boats and be able to play between two players. Potentially an AI function so you can see two ai's fighting it out.
being able to create your own custome boats would be a nice update as well.
## Technologies used
[python3]<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>
## Testing
the majority of the testing is done through the terminal in VS code and gitpod.
There were a few bugs with previous itterations of this project which you will find within the comments made, using things such as classes and __init__ 
as an example. But I ran into a lot of errors that I didn't know how to fix so I reverted back to a very basic version.
