# JPT-96-MSProject3(Black Jack)

## About
For my Python project I decided to go with a very simple version of blackJack game.


## Features
This game has cards designed and has a simple hit or hold function and will keep going till you hit 21.
## design
the design of the cards is used with print statements using | and - to for the bases of a card whilst calling f prints to print the value of said card.

### Future Features
I would like to add currency (not real) to make it feel like your gambling for more immersion in this game.
## Technologies used
[python3]<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>
## Testing
the majority of the testing is done through the terminal in VS code and gitpod.
There were a few bugs with previous itterations of this project which you will find within the comments made, using things such as classes and __init__ 
as an example. But I ran into a lot of errors that I didn't know how to fix so I reverted back to a very basic version.
